              <p class="character">GEMMA</p>
              <p class="dialogue">Mark?</p>

              <p>
                He stares at her.
                This is Innie Mark's first time seeing the real Gemma.
                She holds out her hand.
              </p>

              <p class="character">HELLY (O.S.)</p>
              <p class="dialogue">Mark!</p>

              <p>
                Mark turns around and sees Helly round the dog-leg into the
                small portion of hallway where he is.
                She stops, seeing Mark.
                They lock eyes.
              </p>

              <p class="character">GEMMA</p>
              <p class="dialogue">
                Mark, what's going on?
                Come on!
                We have to go!
              </p>

              <p>
                Mark looks back to her, looking for any feeling of connection.
                Any sense that the woman in front of him is his wife.
                But he doesn't find it.

                This is a stranger.
              </p>

              <p class="character">GEMMA (CONT'D)</p>
              <p class="dialogue">
                Mark, please!
                I-- We have to get out of here!
                We have to go home!
              </p>

              <p>
                Mark looks at Gemma again. Then back to Helly.
                He's torn, conflicted - but deep down knows what he wants.
                He shuts the door to the South Stairwell.

                On Gemma, watching the door shut in front of her.

                Mark turns back to Helly.

                They walk towards each other, lights flashing, alarms blaring.
                They face each other.

                He takes her hand and they head off together,
                back into the Severed floor -

                the only home they've ever shared.

                  The closure she wanted, the goodbye she was after: it's not possible.<br>
                  The thing on the table is not Vision.<br>
                  <b>Devastated, she goes.<br>
                  Exactly as she came:</b><br>
                  alone.

                  Wanda parks and gets out.<br>
                  She stands before the plot of land, and looks at the ENVELOPE in her hand.<br>
                  She opens it.<br>
                  CLOSE ON: a construction site overview of the units of this development.<br>
                  One plot is circled.<br>
                  Then handwriting...

              <p>
                  Wanda looks up from the 2-D image on the page, and there it is.<br>
                  The real thing.<br>
                  Just a half-built foundation.<br>
                  Empty.<br>
                  She walks through what would have been the front door.<br>
                  Wanda has never felt so alone.<br>
                  Tears stream down her cheeks.<br>
                  We hear the familiar tick tick ticking of a bomb.<br>
                  Something inside Wanda breaks.<br>
                  &nbsp;<br>
                  And then...<br>

                what I did with my friends that I lost track of time.<br>
